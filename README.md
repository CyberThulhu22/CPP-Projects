# CPP-Projects
Small repository for CPP projects in their infancy. This is a repository of Code I have created that will have been tested in my own environment. They are subject for updates and improvements as I continuously learn better ways to complete objectives. None of the code should be used directly in production or enterprise environments without proper approval authorities. Furthermore, testing should be continuous to ensure proper coding practices, security, and usage are maintained.
